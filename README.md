# README

What it currently has: 
- scaffold of inputting words used, etc. 

Things this needs to do:

* Give a test on (user selects #) 10-15 words user learned. randomly pulls from other definitions. 

* If doing flash cards, a way to gauge time?


*once deployed, export my current database with my progress/everything


Current problem: 
* Trying to figure out models (also, if I want to learn other languages). For languages, then test have many words, or what.
